      Geospatial divided into two: Cultural and Physical. Cultural administration is vector data such as line regions, railways, borders arising from human civilization and this data has a data format shapefile (shp) while the Physical is the vector data such as coastlines, rivers and have shapefile format as well.
        And is divided into two types of vector and raster data. Raster data has a data format TIFF (which already accompanied .tfw the data, so the data is GIS) and has had staining. Vector Data is data in the form of lines, dots such as when creating maps and data formats are shapefile (shp). Shapefile function is used to store data and compute geospatial data
